# SWBCForIOT
A Major project on SLIDING WINDOW BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE FOR INTERNET OF THINGS tp improve security for IOT devices working over any network

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the idea of allowing the Internet to be connected
to non-traditional computers and related resources, which includes incorporating basic
computing and communication technologies for daily use into physical things. Security and
confidentiality are two of IoT's main challenges. The current security mechanisms, due to the
limitations in the CPU, memory, and energy resources of the IoT devices, do not include
critical security specifications in IoT. In addition, centralized security architectures are not
appropriate for IoT because of a single attack point. It is costly to defend against targeted
attacks on centralized infrastructure. Therefore, it is important to decentralize the IoT security
architecture and to meet the resource constraint. Blockchain is a decentralized encryption
system with a number of uses. However, because of its high computational complexity and
poor scalability, blockchain in its original form is not suitable for IoT. In this paper, we
propose a blockchain slider window (SWBC) architecture to suit IoT applications, changing
the conventional blockchain. The proposed blockchain sliding window uses previous blocks
in proof of work to shape the next hash block. SWBC's results are analyzed on a data stream
generated from an intelligent home test bed in real-time. The findings show that the
blockchain architecture proposed improves security and reduces overhead memory and less
resource consumption.
